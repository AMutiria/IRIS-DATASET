**PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

Task 1: Classical ML with Scikit-learn

Dataset: Iris Species Dataset

Goal:

Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode labels).

Train a decision tree classifier to predict iris species.

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, and recall.

Deliverable: Python script/Jupyter notebook with comments explaining each step.

Task 2: Deep Learning with TensorFlow/PyTorch

Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits

Goal:

Build a CNN model to classify handwritten digits.

Achieve >95% test accuracy.

Visualize the model’s predictions on 5 sample images.

Deliverable: Code with model architecture, training loop, and evaluation.

Task 3: NLP with spaCy

Text Data: User reviews from Amazon Product Reviews.

Goal:

Perform named entity recognition (NER) to extract product names and brands.

Analyze sentiment (positive/negative) using a rule-based approach.

Deliverable: Code snippet and output showing extracted entities and sentiment.
